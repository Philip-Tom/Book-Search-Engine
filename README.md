# MERN Book Search Engine

This is a book search engine application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application uses GraphQL and Apollo Server to handle queries and mutations, providing an efficient and modern API structure. Users can search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorite books to their account.
